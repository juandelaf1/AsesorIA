"""Adapter: the single boundary between the interface and the RAG backend.

`app.py` only knows this module and the contract (`contracts.py`).  This is
where the mock is swapped for the real engine once it exists:

    MockRAG (today)  →  src/rag/engine.py (tomorrow, RAG team)

No Chroma, LangChain, embeddings, prompts or LLM providers in the UI.

Observed real contract (checked in ``src/rag/engine.py`` on branch
``feat/rag-engine-latency`` — NOT merged into main yet at wiring time):

* entry point ``get_rag_engine(top_k: int = 8, score_threshold: float = 0.82)``
  returns a singleton ``RAGEngine``;
* it does **not** accept ``session_id`` → the adapter does not invent one:
  session-scoped retrieval stays a documented backend follow-up;
* ``RAGEngine.query(question: str) -> dict`` returns
  ``{"question", "answer", "sources": [{"source", "page": "Pág. N",
  "snippet"}], "metrics", "raw_documents"}`` — no ``documents``, no
  ``history`` (yet) and no ``grounded``/``no_answer`` keys;
* ``RAGPipeline.answer_query(question)`` (on main) remains the lower layer.

Integration (ONLY this file is touched):

    def create_backend(session_id: str | None = None):
        from src.rag.engine import get_rag_engine   # RAG team
        return get_rag_engine()   # signature has no session_id: not invented

The engine may expose ``query(question, documents)``, ``ask(...)`` or the
pipeline's ``answer_query(question)`` (sync or async): the adapter inspects
the signature and passes ``documents`` only when the method accepts them.
Whatever it returns is normalized with ``RAGResponse.from_any`` (engine
source aliases ``source``/``snippet`` and the page label are mapped in
:func:`_translate_engine_sources`), so missing metadata, LangChain-like
objects or ``None`` lists never break the interface.

Fallback policy — real backend bugs are NEVER converted into the mock:
:func:`create_backend` returns ``None`` (demo mock) only when the engine
module is absent from this build or construction fails with a
configuration error (``ValueError``: missing API key / unsupported
provider). Every other import or construction failure raises, and
query-time errors always propagate.
